## About

Cyrpto_Calculator is an analysis program that is intended to help you make smart investments in cyrptocurrencies. Currently, our program supports Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Etherium. This command tool can get you the prices for your curriences, and it can also show you how much the coin would be worth if it increased. This tool is still in ALPHA development with features still being added. Suggestions on what to add are helpful and recommended. 

## **How to download**

 1. Download the code to your computer.
 2. Ensure that Python 2.7 is installed
 3. Run Main.py to start the program
*GIT Source control is highly recommended. Please pull everyday as changes are imminent and unscheduled*

Thank you for having an interest in developing for Cyrpto_Calculator. We are currently in ALPHA development stage and have a few more features to add before we go to BETA stage. In addition, we can offer mentorship to new developers. A first step that you might consider is checking out our issues tab and our projects tab. If you find  an issue that you would like to work on. Please work on it. All we ask is that you follow the protocals below

We recommend installing the ATOM IDE and installing Autopep8 this will make it easier to format your code as the rules are many.

Guideline
 1. Do *not* directly fix a bug. Please create a branch and then submit your fix through a pull request
 2. Test your code. Even if your feature works, it could break something else in the codebase. So perfom a simple unit test       before submitting
 3. Make sure your code is PEP-8 compliant. We recommend the ATOM IDE and a pep8 auto fixer.
 4. Please do not plagerize code. It is against our code of honor and can give our project a bad reputation
 
 ### **A good simple contribution**
 The core of this application is to have as many cyrpto-currencies as possible. Currently, we use the cyrptonator API to get  our prices. In addition, this API has many other currencies other than Litecoin, Bitcoin, and Etherium. If you want to add, for example, the Dogecoin currency, this API will allow you to do so.
