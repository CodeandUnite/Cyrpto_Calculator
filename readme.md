## About

Cyrpto_Calculator is an analysis program that is intended to help you make smart investments in cyrptocurrencies. Currently, our program supports Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Etherium. This command tool can get you the prices for your curriences, and it can also show you how much the coin would be worth if it increased. This tool is still in ALPHA development with features still being added. Suggestions on what to add are helpful and recommended. 

## **How to download**

 1. Download the code to your computer.
 2. Ensure that Python 2.7 is installed
 3. Run Main.py to start the program
*GIT Source control is highly recommended. Please pull everyday as changes are imminent and unscheduled*


## **Contribute**

If you would like to contribute than we could definetly use your help. As of now, we are currently in the ALPHA development stage of this software product. Moreover, this means that we have quite a few features that need to be added before this software is released to the public. Below are just some the contributors that we are in need of:
1. Documentation
2. Code Testing
3. Feature development
4. Leadership oppurtunities

A good first step, regardless of developer skill level, is to check our issues tab on our project issues page. If you find an issue that interests you, we definetly encourage you to work on it. Please, if you ever need help, do not hesitate to contact us on Discord. One of our core developers will be glad to help you. For more experienced developers, we are currently in search of several core developers. These areas are 1. Testing and 2. GUI development. If you are interested, please contact Austin on Discord.

### *Contribution guidelines
As a open source software product, it is our mission to make it safe, enjoyable, and functionable by our users. Therefore, we have a few guidelines that we require all contributors to abide by. 

1. Write good legible code
2. Follow the PEP8 style guide
3. Accept that you may need to rewrite your code several times
4. Test your code by making simple unit tests

We recommend using a linter to ensure your code is PEP8 compliant. In addition, please read up on https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html if you are new to testing. We've been relaxed on testing for ALPHA. However, it is now a requirement.
