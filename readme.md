[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CodeandUnite/Cyrpto_Calculator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CodeandUnite/Cyrpto_Calculator)

 We are a simple calculator for cyrpto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Etherium. Our command line tool allows you to get the price for your currencies fast and within your compiler. In addition, we allow you to do simple analysis so you can make wise decision in choosing to purchase certain cyrpto-currencies.


**NOTE: We are currently  under EARLY ALPHA release with many bugs being fixed **

 1. Download the code to your computer.
 2. Ensure that Python 2.7 is installed

## **Contribute**
Discord Developer chat room: https://discord.gg/mJN9Md
We could use great developers like you! If you found an error in our program, or you simply want to make an enhancement you are very welcome to do so! The first step you will want to do is repo this into your own Github account. Then you will need to create a Branch that will be submitted for review by us. The only requirement is that your code is PEP-8 compliant.(Btw, we could use some assistance making existing code PEP-8 compliant. Starting with Alpha 2 PEP-8 will be a requirement. Please feel free to chat with us on Discord if you have any questions or need help. 

We recommend installing the ATOM IDE and installing Autopep8 this will make it easier to format your code as the rules are many.
